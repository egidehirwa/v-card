## Things l got to test:

- Positioning elements
- Flexbox for laying out the content
- using css variables for colors
- Adding Fontawesome icons
- Used REM units

## Challenges:

- Converted everything from using position absolute and it was a hassle ðŸ˜… (only the hamburger is left hanging)

## Awesome wins:

- Animating elements with pure css
